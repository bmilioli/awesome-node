# Simple MVC Project with Node.js and TypeScript

This repository represents a basic MVC project structure using **Node.js** and **TypeScript**. It showcases the foundation I find useful in my personal projects. The idea behind this project is to keep things as simple as possible while still being effective.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Iâ€™m always open to tips that could help me improve the project and make it more efficient.

## Features

- **AWS S3** for image storage
- **Express** for routing and server management
- **bcrypt** for password hashing and security
- **pm2** to keep the application online and running smoothly
